Coders
======
Encoders and Decoders for RF and IR protocols used for remote control and data acquisition.
Both Encoders and Decoders can be supplied as plugins in the NetHome server to support new protocols.
They can also be used as plugins in the ProtocolAnalyzer tool, which is designed to aid in reverse engineering of
simple pulse length based protocols.
